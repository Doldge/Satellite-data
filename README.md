# Satellite-data

By Default, it gets the latest image. You can pass an int as ARG1, which the script will use the number of days
backwards of now to start collecting images from. e.g. if the current time is 10:00:00 am, on 2016-01-30,
and I call the script with ARG1 as 20, then all images from 10:00:00 am on 2016-01-10 to 2016-01-30 will be downloaded.
